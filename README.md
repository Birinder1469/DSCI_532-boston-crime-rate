# DSCI_532-boston-crime-rate
The development of a shiny app using the city of Boston's crime rate. 


### Section 1: Overview

Like any typical city, it is good knowledge for the city to know what type of crime is expected in certain areas of the city. This helps to properly allocate the necessary resources to these areas in order to manage it and preventing these specific types of crimes. We are attempting for this milestone to create a shiny application that visualizes the data of criminal records by location and type. We hope to make the app interactive by allowing the user see the crime rate as a type of heat map, with the ability to filter by several different features including the day of the week and specific time of day which will help in the proper allocation of resources to the necessary area and time.
